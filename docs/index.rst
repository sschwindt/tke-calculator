About
=====

This Python3 code aids in analyzing raw measurements with an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) producing ``*.vno`` and ``*.vna`` files. It detects and removes spikes according to `Nikora and Goring (1998) <https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1998)124:6(630)>`_ and  `Goring and Nikora (2002) <https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2002)128:1(117)>`_.

The code was originally developed in Matlab(R) at the `Nepf Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory <https://nepf.mit.edu/>`_ (`Massachusetts Institute of Technology <https://web.mit.edu/>`_).

.. important::

    ``*.vno`` and ``*.vna`` files need to comply with the following name convetion:
    ``XX_YY_ZZ_something.vna`` where ``XX``, ``YY``, and ``ZZ`` are streamwise (x), perpendicular (y), and vertical (z) coordinates in CENTIMETERS, respectively. Anything else added after ``ZZ_`` is ignore by the code (it just copies it for the sake of dataset naming).

.. note::

Requirements \& Installation
============================

*Time requirement: 5-10 min.*

Get Python
----------

To get the code running, the following software is needed and their installation instructions are provided below:

- Python `>=3.6`
- NumPy `>=1.20`
- Openpyxl `3.0.3`
- Pandas `>=1.4.1`
- Matplotlib `>=3.5.0`

Start with downloading and installing the latest version of `Anaconda Python <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.  Alternatively, downloading and installing a pure `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ interpreter will also work. Detailed information about installing Python is available in the `Anaconda Docs <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/windows/>`_ and at `hydro-informatics.com/python-basics <https://hydro-informatics.com/python-basics/pyinstall.html>`_.

To install the NumPy, Openpyxl, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries after installing Anaconda, open Anaconda Prompt (e.g., click on the Windows icon, tap ``anaconda prompt``, and hit enter``). In Anaconda Prompt, enter the following command sequence to install the libraries in the **base** environment. The installation may take a while depending on your internet speed.

.. code-block::

    conda install -c anaconda numpy
    conda install -c anaconda openpyxl
    conda install -c anaconda numpy
    conda install -c conda-forge pandas
    conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib

If you are struggling with the dark window and blinking cursor of Anaconda Prompt, worry not. You can also use Anaconda Navigator and install the four libraries (in the above order) in Anaconda Navigator.

.. note::

    Alternatively, create a new conda environment to install the three libraries for this application. However, creating a new environment may eat up a lot of disk space and installing the Python-omnipresent libraries NumPy, Openpyxl, Pandas, and Maplotlib in the **base** environment does not hurt.
